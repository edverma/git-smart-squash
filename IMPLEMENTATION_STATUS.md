## 🚀 **Enhanced Features Implemented**

### **Zero-Friction CLI (`gss`)**
```bash
# Primary usage (90% of cases)
gss                    # Clean current branch commits

# Common options (9% of cases)  
gss --preview          # Show plan without executing
gss --base main       # Use different base branch
gss --force           # Override safety checks

# Utility commands (1% of cases)
gss --status          # Check repository readiness
```

### **Professional Output Design**
```
🔍 Analyzing 23 commits since main...

📊 Found 4 logical groups:
  • Feature (auth): User authentication system (12 commits)
  • Fix: Handle edge case in login validation (3 commits)  
  • Docs: Update API documentation (5 commits)
  • Refactor (validation): Simplify validation logic (3 commits)

🤖 Generated professional commit messages
✅ High confidence (85%) - executing automatically...

🎉 Successfully organized 23 commits into 4 clean commits!
